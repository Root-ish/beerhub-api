## Testing
Testing is done using Mocha and Chai, more specifically `chai-http` for doing requests to the API. All test files can be found in the `test` directory. All routes and models have their own test file, a test for a specific route of model can be found by searching for `<file-name>.test.js` in the `test` directory.
